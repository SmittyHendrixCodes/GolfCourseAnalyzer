- About the Project

Golf Course Analyzer is designed to help golf enthusiasts and course managers store, analyze, and visualize golf course data. The two primary focused are (1) calculating the difficulty of each course based on metrics such as Slope and Rating, and presenting these results in a visually appealing manner, and (2) calculating the efficiency of Golfers using data provided by the golfer themselves.

- Features

Add, (edit and delete in progress) golf course entries

Add, (edit and delete in progress) ggolfer data entries

Calculate the difficulty of courses using Slope and Rating

Calculate the efficiency of a Golfer using general data

Visualize course difficulty with interactive bar charts

Visualize strengths and weaknesses of Golfers

Customizable menu options for easy navigation

Error handling and user prompts for smooth interaction

- Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language

SQLite: Database for storing course data

Plotly: Library for creating interactive charts

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

PyQt5: GUI for user firnedly experience
